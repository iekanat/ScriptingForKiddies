The module heavily relies on Module 04, Linux Command Line basics. Therefore, I would recommend that the students go through Module 04 before tackling this module.

[01 - \#\! Where it all Starts](M05_01_SheBang.md) In this activity we will learn how to write our first script.

[02 - Getting into Arguments With a Script](M5_02_Arguments.md) In this activity we will learn how to use arguments with scripts.

[03 - Options](M5_03_Options.md) In this activity we will learn about passign options to scripts.
